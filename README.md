# Paint.NET-load
A "cloned" loading screen from scriptfodder ( https://scriptfodder.com/scripts/view/2415 ) and yes, this fits on your screen.
I gave it a snazzy title cause of Neth's comment on facepunch 8)

##Credits

avasdemon.com - for the color scheme

scriptfodder - for accepting a low-ass-tier loading screen to be sold

atomik - no reason at all

#Remember
Use ?steamid=%s in your sv_loadingurl cause shit won't work if you don't.
